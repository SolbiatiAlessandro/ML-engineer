## [Completed] MiniGPT

Implementation of "Attention is All You Need" trasfomer architecture with minimal pytorch APIs, similar to [karpathy/minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT). This is the next word prediction cross-entropy loss achieved on the Shakespeare dataset with different baselines.

*the number of parameters is wrong, should be in the range of millions. Re-running the best model with Karpathy hyperparams achieved a validation loss of 1.66. This is an example generation of Shakespeare like text with Transformer@3k parameters.

## [*Completed*] Makemore

Replicated the makemore repo from Karpathy from his Zero to Hero NN course. Implementation of name-generation language models. Bi-grams, MLP, RNNs and other models in plain pytorch. This is the performance I was able to reproduce independently on the several architectures covered in the course.

Here are some interesting histogram from hyperparameter search on some simple language model

## [*Completed*] Micrograd

Python-only implemention of Neural Networks. Playing with my own implementation of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) from Karpathy. Some interesting results

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/ML-system-design/refs/heads/main/imgs/micrograd-MLP.svg)

- [make_moons_30_Jan_A.ipynb](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/ML-system-design/blob/main/micrograd/make_moons_30_Jan_A.ipynb) - a small MLP is able to optimize loss function, but it learns a linear function. Not able to make the model learn non linearity.
- [make_moons_30_Jan_B.ipynb](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/ML-system-design/blob/main/micrograd/make_moons_30_Jan_B.ipynb) - a small MLP with more techniques is able to learn non linear function from scikit learn moon. The circles function are half learned but not completely

## [*Completed*] Zero Shot LLM Retrieval

Using VMWare docs corpus (30M documents) from Kaggle to implement a e2e retrieval system using LLM encoders and generative models. Picture below is the tensorboard of the 12 stacked transformer blocks from https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-small-v2 used for text embedding

## [*Completed*] SparseNN Recommender System 

Using Fashion Recommender System dataset to build a muli-stage ranking recommender system for 10M users and 100k fashion articles [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations)

- [personalized-fashion-recommendation-2-Feb-B.ipynb](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/ML-system-design/blob/main/personalized-fashion-recommendations/personalized-fashion-recommendation-2-Feb-B.ipynb) TTSN model for candidate retrieval, trained only on categorical features with customer and article tower, improving recall@1000 from 1% to 10%. Will probably need to bring recall higher before moving on to ranking stage.
