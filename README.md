# alex-micrograd

Playing with my own implementation of micrograd from Karpathy. Some interesting results

- make_moons_30_Jan_A.ipynb - a small MLP is able to optimize loss function, but it learns a linear function. Not able to make the model learn non linearity.
- make_moons_30_Jan_B.ipynb - a small MLP with more techniques is able to learn non linear function from scikit learn moon. The circles function are half learned but not completely
