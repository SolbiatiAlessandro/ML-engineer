## see how much I get get from TTSN model

modelling
- regularization to TTSN model
- dropout + batch norm + L2
- MLP on top of embedding concat
- GBDT top features
features data
- datacleaning probably good ? or go directly to embedding
- price and sales channel_id data
training 
- test/train, get precision
- larger training data and batch size

metrics
- submitted first output, got 0.0002
- sample output is 0.002
- best on leaderboard is 0.02

kind of low, worth doing enconding and cleaning of all dense features to build TTSN, and than can get precision at 1000?
sparse feature on recommender

wow time component is really important, I totally missed that
so many interesting stuff on time component

## after conversion + historical features

## after sparse features
