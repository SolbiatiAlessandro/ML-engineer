## see how much I get get from TTSN model

modelling
- regularization to TTSN model
- dropout + batch norm + L2
- MLP on top of embedding concat
- GBDT top features
features data
- datacleaning probably good ? or go directly to embedding
- price and sales channel_id data
training 
- test/train, get precision
- larger training data and batch size

## after conversion + historical features

## after sparse features
